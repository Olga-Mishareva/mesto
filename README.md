# Project Mesto. Frontend

---

The social network for communication with pictures and likes.

The site is adapted for resolution from 320px to 1280px and more. It is possible to change profile name and description, add, delete and like photos as well as open large-size photos. All forms are validated using JS. The principles of object-oriented programming are applied.

The project is connected to a server. Changes to user information and his avatar are made by changing data on the server. The cards are loaded from the server from the group's common database. Any user can give or take away a like to any card. Only your own cards can be deleted.
